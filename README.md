# SQL-Tutoring-Questions:

Going on my 4th semester, I am a Teaching Assistant for a class focusing on SQL. We use [Google Cloud Platform's Bigquery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) to teach students different concepts and capabilities of SQL. The .sql file you see here are some challenge questions used in different sessions

These queries make use of [Bigquery's Public Datasets](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/browse?filter=solution-type:dataset)
